            <h2>What is the KMC?</h2>
            <p>Invented by students, for students, the KEGS Mathematical Challenge, often abbreviated to "KMC", is meant to serve as an extension to the standard Maths curriculum for those in Years 7,8 and 9, by engaging them with thought-provoking problems. Each problem set out in the various question papers has been carefully designed, with logic, reasoning and problem-solving in mind.</p>

            <h2>What is in the papers?</h2>
            <p>In each paper, there are 25 mathematical problems. These are approximately set out in order of difficulty, with easier problems near the beginning and more challenging questions closer to the end. The later problems have been crafted to be very difficult, and so you should not expect to finish in the time allocated to the paper. It is far more beneifical to answer 5 easier questions correctly, and gain marks for these, than ponder over 1 hard question and only come out with a partial answer. </p>

            <h2>Why do the KMC?</h2>
            <p>The KMC's innovative approach to maths problems means, unlike more traditional challenges, uses questions targetted specifically to stretch students in the various year groups that can participate. </p>
