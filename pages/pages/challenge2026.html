            <h2>The 1st Year of the KMC</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the KMC! We are delighted to announce that Challenge 2026 is the inaugural year of the KEGS Mathematical Challenge. Since this is the first year, and new methods are being tried and tested, some parts of the competition such as marking may take a little longer than they will in the future.
